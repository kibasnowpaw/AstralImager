# FF15 SS to JPG Converter

## Description

This Python script is specially designed for gamers and fans of Final Fantasy XV. It effortlessly converts the game's `.ss` screenshot files into the universally accessible `.jpg` format while preserving the original file's timestamp.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: Simply place the script in the directory containing your `.ss` files and run it.
- **Preserves Timestamp**: The conversion retains the original timestamp of the `.ss` files.
- **Batch Conversion**: Converts all `.ss` files in the directory simultaneously.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script directly.
2. Place the script in the same directory where your `.ss` screenshot files are stored.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```shell
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace "script_name.py" with the actual name of the script.

4. All `.ss` files in the directory will be converted to `.jpg`, and users will be notified of each successful conversion.

## Example

If you have a `.ss` file named `screenshot.ss`, after running the script, you'll have a `screenshot.jpg` in the same directory with the `.ss` file's original timestamp.
