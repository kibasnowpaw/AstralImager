# AstralImager
This script converts Final Fantasy XV's .ss screenshot files to .jpg format. It extracts .ss files from the current directory, removes their specific headers/footers, and writes the core image data to a new .jpg file, retaining the original file's timestamp. Users are notified of each successful conversion via a printed message.
